This is a multi-purposed repository, where I plan to push code to anything that I feel it's worth solving using the Clojure language.

I am mostly a C# and Golang programmer, with few experience with function language, so this is an opportunity for me to get my hands dirty.

The majority of code written here is aimed at solving 2020 advent of code problems. 

Each folder contains a readme describing the problem being address and a short explanation on the proposed solution, where it makes sense.
